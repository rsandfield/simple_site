            Debris is a recreation of a classic arcade game wherein a player controls a    
            spaceship on a looping 2D plane hunting down asteroids before they impact the
            ship and damage it. The player my turn, thrust, and fire projectiles while
            dodging the asteroids and occasional alien spaceships which may also threaten
            them. Points are scored for successfully destroying pieces of debris and levels
            are cleared by destroying all targets.
