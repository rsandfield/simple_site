			Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players. A codemaker devises 
			a code as a set of colored pegs. A codebreaker then attempts to figure
			out the code through a series of guesses. The codemaker gives feedback
			after each guess in the form of a key: a black peg for every peg of the 
			correct color in the correct spot, and a white peg for ever peg of the 
			correct color in the wrong spot; the position of the keys have nothing
			to do with the solution. The codemaker wins if the codebreaker cannot
			guess the code correctly in the set number of turns. The codebreaker
			wins if they successfully guess the code in time.
